The name of the project is from Electric Wizard's song ["Patterns of Evil"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUW9fRMCEOA)

Work inspired by :
- The movement of my vinyl records. Mesmerizing, [just like this](https://vimeo.com/149302777) üç•
- Electric Wizard's song ["Saturnine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NY7a9kMvPY) and all kind of psych doom occult music
- [Gustave Dor√©'s engraving](http://www.worldofdante.org/gallery_dore.html)
- Chan Hwee Chong's [work and video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHrjn8kAnqk) for Faber Castell
- [Paolo ƒåeriƒá](http://patakk.tumblr.com/)'s work
